Homework Management System

4 Scenarios

1. Registration-verifying that  the ID the user has chosen  is unique , and not already in the database
2. Search for online homework resources by keywords  through an input element on their home page.
3. Browse list of books. Using a D3.js tree map visualization, the books are shown  with individual headlines and grouped together by subject. 
4. View posts of Q&A form. When a user hovers over a post, a popup is displayed that contains a short snippet of the post.


The two scenarios that we are doing for HW 3 are:

1. Registration-verifying that  the ID the user has chosen  is unique , and not already in the database
2. Search for online homework resources by keywords  through an input element on their home page.
