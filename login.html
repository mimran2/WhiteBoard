		<h2>Welcome to WhiteBoard</h2>
		<p>WhiteBoard is a homework management system for college Students and Teachers. Once the homework is published by the teacher for a particular class section, it will be automatically added to the student's account with an autogenerated email notification. Also, WhiteBoard allows you to store course related material such as notes, links, files etc. Students have the ability to share their resources with a group of students of their preference.
